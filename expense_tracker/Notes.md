# Notes

- ```dart
  Expense({
      required this.title,
      required this.amount,
      required this.data,
  }) : id = uuid.v4();
  ```

  This is a named constructor for the Expense class.

  The constructor takes three named parameters: title, amount, and data, all of which are marked as required.

  The : syntax introduces an initializer list, which is used to initialize the id field with a new UUID generated by calling uuid.v4().

- Enums are useful for representing a fixed set of related values. Here's how you can use the Category enum in Dart:

  ```dart
  enum Category { food, travel, leisure, work }

  final Category category;

  // switch statement
  void printCategory(Category category) {
  switch (category) {
      case Category.food:
      print('Food category');
      break;
      case Category.travel:
      print('Travel category');
      break;
      case Category.leisure:
      print('Leisure category');
      break;
      case Category.work:
      print('Work category');
      break;
  }
  }

  // iterating over enums
  for (Category category in Category.values) {
  print(category);
  }


  // getting the index of an enum value;
  int index = Category.food.index; // index will be 0

  // converting enum to string
  String categoryName = Category.food.toString();

  ```

- ```dart
      @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return const Scaffold(
      body: Column(
          children: [
          Text('The Chart'),
          Text('Expenses List...'),
          ],
      ),
      );
  }
  ```

  - build method :The build method is a required method in a Flutter widget that describes how to display the widget in the UI. It takes a BuildContext as a parameter and returns a Widget.
  - Parameters :

    - itemCount: The total number of items in the list. In this case, it is expenses.length, which means the number of items in the list is equal to the number of elements in the expenses list.

    - itemBuilder: A function that is called to build each item in the list. It takes two parameters:
      ctx: The BuildContext for the widget.
      index: The index of the item being built.

- BuildContext : in flutter is an object that provides information about the location of a widget in the widget tree. It is used to access theme data, locate other widget in the widget tree, and more. Essentially, it is handle to the location of a widget tree and is used to interact with the widget's env.

  - Accessing Theme Data: You can use BuildContext to access the theme data of the application, such as colors, text styles, etc.
  - Locating Widgets: It helps in locating other widgets in the widget tree, which is useful for tasks like finding the nearest Scaffold or Navigator.
  - Building Widgets: It is passed to the build method of a widget, allowing the widget to build its UI based on its position in the widget tree.

- Expanded Widget

  ```dart
    Expanded(child: ExpensesList(expenses: _registeredExpenses))
  ```

  - Expanded:
    Expanded is a widget that expands a child of a Row, Column, or Flex so that the child fills the available space along the main axis. It is commonly used to make sure that a widget takes up all the available space in a flexible layout
    - The Expanded widget is used within a Row, Column, or Flex to make its child widget take up the remaining available space. It is useful for creating flexible layouts where you want certain widgets to expand and fill the available space.

- Card Widget

  - The card widget in flutter is a material design that proviees a rectangular area with rounded corners and a shadow. It is commonly used to create visually distinct sections in your app's ui, such as displaying information in a structured and aesthecially please way.
  - properties : child, color, elavation, shape, margin, clipBehavior
  -

  ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

    void main() {
      runApp(MyApp());
    }

    class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return MaterialApp(
          home: Scaffold(
            appBar: AppBar(
              title: Text('Card Widget Example'),
            ),
            body: Center(
              child: Card(
                elevation: 5,
                shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
                  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
                ),
                child: Padding(
                  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                  child: Column(
                    mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
                    children: <Widget>[
                      Text(
                        'Card Title',
                        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                      ),
                      SizedBox(height: 10),
                      Text(
                        'This is a card widget example in Flutter.',
                        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        );
      }
  ```

- Padding Widgets and its different parameters

  - The Padding widget in Flutter is used to add empty space (padding) around its child widget. This is useful for creating space between widgets and ensuring that the UI elements are not too close to each other.
  - EdgeInsets.all(double value): Creates padding with the same value on all four sides.
  - EdgeInsets.symmetric({double vertical, double horizontal}): Creates padding with different values for vertical and horizontal sides.
  - EdgeInsets.only({double left, double top, double right, double bottom}): Creates padding with different values for each side.
  - EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(double left, double top, double right, double bottom): Creates padding with different values for each side, similar to only.

- Spacer widget

  - The Spacer widget in Flutter is used to create flexible space between widgets in a Row, Column, or Flex layout. It takes up any remaining space in the main axis of its parent, distributing the space proportionally if there are multiple Spacer widgets.

  - Key Properties of Spacer
    flex: An integer that determines how much space the Spacer should take relative to other Spacer widgets. The default value is 1.

- ListView.builder

  - The ListView.builder widget in Flutter is a powerful and efficient way to create a scrollable list of widgets that are built on demand. This is particularly useful when dealing with large lists, as it only builds the widgets that are visible on the screen, improving performance.

  - Key Properties of ListView.builder
    - itemCount: The total number of items in the list. If null, the list is considered infinite.
    - itemBuilder: A function that is called to build each item in the list. It takes two parameters: the BuildContext and the index of the item to be built.
    - scrollDirection: The axis along which the list scrolls (horizontal or vertical). The default is vertical.
    - reverse: Whether the list should be reversed (i.e., start from the bottom or the right). The default is false.
    - padding: The amount of space to add around the list.
    - shrinkWrap: Whether the extent of the scroll view in the scrollDirection should be determined by the contents being viewed. The default is false.
    - physics: Defines how the scroll view should respond to user input.

- Flex in Flutter

  - In Flutter, the equivalents to CSS Flexbox and Grid layout systems are the Row, Column, and GridView widgets. These widgets allow you to create flexible and grid-based layouts similar to what you can achieve with Flexbox and Grid in web development.

  - Flexbox Equivalents: Row and Column
  - Row: Arranges its children horizontally.
  - Column: Arranges its children vertically.
  - Both Row and Column widgets use the Flex class under the hood, which provides properties similar to Flexbox, such as mainAxisAlignment, crossAxisAlignment, and flex.

  ```dart
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      void main() {
        runApp(MyApp());
      }

      class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
        @override
        Widget build(BuildContext context) {
          return MaterialApp(
            home: Scaffold(
              appBar: AppBar(
                title: Text('Row and Column Example'),
              ),
              body: Column(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                children: <Widget>[
                  Row(
                    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
                    children: <Widget>[
                      Container(color: Colors.red, width: 50, height: 50),
                      Container(color: Colors.green, width: 50, height: 50),
                      Container(color: Colors.blue, width: 50, height: 50),
                    ],
                  ),
                  SizedBox(height: 20),
                  Row(
                    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
                    children: <Widget>[
                      Container(color: Colors.yellow, width: 50, height: 50),
                      Container(color: Colors.orange, width: 50, height: 50),
                      Container(color: Colors.purple, width: 50, height: 50),
                    ],
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            ),
          );
        }
      }
  ```

- Grid in Flutter

  - GridView : creates a scrollable, 2d array of widget, It can be used to create a grid-based layouts.
  -

  ```dart
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      void main() {
        runApp(MyApp());
      }

      class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
        @override
        Widget build(BuildContext context) {
          return MaterialApp(
            home: Scaffold(
              appBar: AppBar(
                title: Text('GridView Example'),
              ),
              body: GridView.builder(
                gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
                  crossAxisCount: 3, // Number of columns
                ),
                itemCount: 9, // Number of items
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  return Container(
                    margin: EdgeInsets.all(4.0),
                    color: Colors.teal[100 * (index % 9)],
                    child: Center(
                      child: Text('Item $index'),
                    ),
                  );
                },
              ),
            ),
          );
        }
      }
  ```

- What is get method?

- AppBar ?

- What is context actuall do ? `showModalBottomSheet(context: context, builder: builder)`

- showDatePicker ?

- Spacer() is separating elements end to end.
